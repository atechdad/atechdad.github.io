    <span class="post-date">13 Jul 2015</span>

    <h2 id="i-did-it-again"><strong>I did it again.</strong></h2>

<p>So- hey again. Several weeks ago, I <a href="http://atechdad.com/i-emailed-97931-users-their-passwords/">wrote about</a> emailing over 97,000 people their own passwords and documented the results. The post was pretty popular. I got lots of feedback from HN, Reddit, via email, and through comments. People were mostly positive and many had very good suggestions. So- I took some of the feedback from folks and did a second experiment.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Got banned from Mandrilla</li>
  <li>Got prebanned from SendGrid</li>
  <li>Rolled a mail server</li>
  <li>Cleaned up password lists</li>
  <li>Rebuilt Email Templates</li>
  <li>Sent 281,317 emails</li>
  <li>Received $82 in donations</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>

<p>I realized that in order to make this more successful I would need to make some changes. I am relatively new to the mass email arena, so I tried to  partner with some known vendors.</p>

<p>I chose Mandrilla. Using their site, I found it very easy to convert my message into one that appeared much more professional and trustworthy. I have to admin, their interface is slick. So I began with a test run and queued up around two thousand emails. I decided to try and track open rates to see if messages were successful.  I kept an eye on the GUI all day.</p>

<p>About 900 emails got out before I was banned.  I couldn’t log in or recover any data - nothing. After discussing with their technical support teams,  there was nothing they could do.</p>

<p>I then called Sendgrid– wanting to see if I could partner with them before I went through all the work of setting things up again. I just got a no.</p>

<p>So I ended up rolling my own mail server.  I cleaned up my email template. I tested and retested the spamminess of my message. I asked my wife for her opinion. I cleaned up the password lists.</p>

<h2 id="so-here-are-the-numbers">So here are the numbers:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Thanks: 68 (+59) or .02%</li>
  <li>Unsubscribes: 29 (-12) or .01%
    <ul>
      <li>Requests when opting out: 4 (+3) or .001%
        <ul>
          <li>stop sending spam</li>
          <li>F**K OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
          <li>f**k off slime bag - do your best to hack me and i’ll find you and let my pet camel f**k you in the *ss.</li>
          <li>F**k off scammer</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Opens: 3,478+ (This one is difficult to measure due to image blocking and other tracking blocks)</li>
  <li>Donations: $82 (+$82)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>I’m not sure. If I’m going to turn this into a service I will need to better optimize delivery and take care of some back office type stuff. If I do this, all of the donations will be reinvested back into the service.</p>

<p>I still consider this effort successful. I look forward to helping more people.</p>

<h2 id="project-location">Project Location</h2>

<p>For those that are curious, the project itself is located <a href="http://urhack.com/robin/">here</a>.</p>

        I Emailed 97,931 Users Their Passwords
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Jun 2015</span>

    <p>Hey all-</p>

<p>I run across lots of passwords on the webs. Passwords to bank accounts, Netflix accounts, email accounts- you name it. Pastebin and its clones are very popular repositories for this kind of information.</p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of <a href="https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Quick+Tip+Pastebin+Monitoring+Recon/12091/">solutions</a> a person can use to collect this password data. Not all of them are malicious.</p>

<p>Some of these scripts are often used to alert a person when one of their own accounts are compromised as a kind of canary. I’ve seen various services where a person can opt-in to be notified if one of their accounts has been compromised. A “Canary As A Service” if you will. I can see two issues with this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Most users have no idea these services exist.</li>
  <li>Many users are wary of sending the information they care most about to another online service.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Experiment</strong></p>

<p>I wondered what would happen if I just emailed this information to the people who owned it. Instead of asking people to opt-in — I could offer them the chance to opt-out.</p>

<p><strong>The Plan</strong></p>

<p>I decided to do this as part of <a href="http://urhack.com">urhack.com</a> and call it <del>canary</del> <a href="http://urhack.com/robin">Robin</a> (the reasoning behind this change is there). I set up the email and a reply address to offer people a chance to unsubscribe. I even set up a PayPal donation button. I didn’t expect anything in return, but thought , “Why not?” five dollars would cover the VPS time.</p>

<p><strong>Collection</strong></p>

<p>For 3 days, I scraped Pastebin looking for email address/password combinations. This seemed to be the easiest target since it was the most active. After removing the garbage, I was left with over <strong>97,000</strong> email:password combinations.</p>

<p><strong>Execution</strong></p>

<p>On May 19th 2015, I sent out the emails. I could have waited for more, but this was only an experiment– and honestly I was getting impatient.</p>

<p><strong>The Message</strong></p>

<p>I tried to keep the message simple:</p>

<p><a href="http://atechdad.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/canary.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-383" src="http://atechdad.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/canary.png" alt="canary" width="888" height="440" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Aftermath</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>9 Thank Yous (0.009%)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The thank you notes I got were sincere. One of them validated the entire effort when the person indicated that they use the same password for everything and wanted to know which account had been compromised.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>100 Delivery Status Notification (Failure) (0.1%)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Many of the addresses contacted were no longer in use for obvious reasons.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>41 unsubscribes (0.041%)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Including one request to F**k off. (0.001%) :)” /&gt;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>29 Spam (0.029%)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Some of these addresses were either compromised accounts which reply to emails with spam or were planted for this purpose.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>$0</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>I received no donations. This was not unexpected– but since the campaign didn’t cost me much, it’s also absolutely fine.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Overall I consider this experiment a success. I hope that many people were helped and did not reply instead of ignoring or losing the email to spam filters.</p>

<p>My next list has been running since May 19th. My current count has around 300k accounts.</p>

<p>I might just do this again.</p>

        A Brief Look at DNS Zone Transfer for Alexia&#8217;s Top 1M Domains
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Apr 2015</span>

    <p>The [Scans.IO][1] project is hosting a new dataset courtesy of Mr. Hanno Böck. This data contains the result of scans against Alexa’s top 1 million domains looking for DNS servers which have allowed unauthenticated requests for Zone Transfer.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>About AXFR</strong>
</p>

<p>The purpose of DNS Zone Transfer (AXFR) is to replicate DNS data across DNS servers. Usually this information is protected with ACLs, but there are many DNS servers which allow unauthenticated requests and provide potentially sensitive information. This information is often used by hackers while conducting recon.</p>

<p>US-CERT even put out an alert in April of 2015. – <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA15-103A">https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA15-103A</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>The Numbers</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I parsed through the files very briefly using standard command-line tools and found some interesting things.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are 67,647 domains exposed or 6.7% of the Alexa top 1 million scanned.</li>
  <li>There are 47,025 unique DNS servers listed.</li>
  <li>451 (or .95%) appear to contain records indicating the use of DNSSEC.</li>
  <li>2,282 of the records contain the word intranet</li>
  <li>285 of the records contain HINFO data
    <ul>
      <li>There are 15,382 HINFO records</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>102 of the DNS servers use the .gov TLD.
    <ul>
      <li>Of these, 8,166 records are exposed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>779 records contain the word password
    <ul>
      <li>Of these, 58 contain both the words password and reset</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>39.5% are .com domain servers</li>
  <li>26,083 records contain the word proxy.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>Top 15 DNS Domains by Count of Exposed Domains</strong>

  <li>.kr – 479</li>
  <li>info – 444</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>Malicious Sites</strong>
</p>

<p>Looks like there may be some nasty domains with enough traffic to be listed in the Alexa top 1 million too:</p>

<pre>axfr loginj.com @ns1-king.vivawebhost.com.
</pre>

<p>This domain has about 1400 subdomains– all appearing to be phishing related.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>autoconfig.wellsfargoonline.loginj[.]com</li>
  <li>www.yahooemail.loginj[.]com</li>
  <li>www.walmartcareers.loginj[.]com</li>
</ul>

<p>According to Alexa, 91.5% of visitors to this site are from the US.</p>

<p>[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-357" src="http://atechdad.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/alexa.png" alt="alexa" width="764" height="333" />][2]</p>

<p>While the site itself is registered to someone in Australia</p>

<pre>Registrant City: Deer Park
Registrant State/Province: Victoria
Registrant Postal Code: 3023
Registrant Country: Australia
</pre>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <b>So now what?</b>
</p>

<p>I did reach out to US-CERT and to one of the VPS providers on the list.</p>

<p>The response from the provider was:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <em>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. While our servers are configured to allow AXFR, the ability to perform them is disabled by default &#8212; it is the responsibility of the user to configure their ACL&#8217;s to allow access to the servers they wish to allow replication between.[&#8230;] </em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I did not receive anything from US-CERT. However, with the alert above, I&#8217;m assuming they are aware of the .gov exposure.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Anyway, the scans are located here:<a href="https://scans.io/study/hanno-axfr"> https://scans.io/study/hanno-axfr</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  If you find anything interesting, let me know.

    <p>Hey all,</p>

<p>As you know from previous posts, I’ve been combing through logs provided by Project Sonar/scans.io for a little while now. The information I was gathering about hacked pages seemed a little large for here so I’ve stood up a custom site : <a href="http://urhack.com">uhack.com</a>. Check it out!</p>

        Karma Rogue AccessPoint Offense with badkarma.py
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Mar 2015</span>

    <p>For those that don’t know, karma is a patch that is applied to hostapd which allows the creation of a wifi honeypot. This honeypot listens for probe requests from devices which announce SSIDs used to autojoin preferred wifi hotspots. The honeypot then spoofs this SSID, luring in unsuspecting devices. Once on the network, many nasty methods can be used to attempt to compromise the device itself, or the data which traverses the access point.</p>

<p><strong>Detection:</strong><br />
This attack can be detected simply by creating a nonsense SSID, and attempting to connect.</p>

<p>First, create a nonsense SSID:</p>

<pre>atechdad@kali:~# sudo ifconfig wlan1 down
atechdad@kali:~# sudo iwconfig wlan1 essid badkarma
atechdad@kali:~# sudo ifconfig wlan1 up
atechdad@kali:~# sudo iwconfig wlan1
</pre>

<p>Then see if we joined. You’ll see we did because Access Point has a MAC assigned.</p>

<pre>wlan0     IEEE 802.11bg  ESSID:"badkarma"  
          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.412 GHz  Access Point: <strong>F6:B1:14:6D:AB:01</strong>   
          Bit Rate=24 Mb/s   Tx-Power=20 dBm   
          Retry short limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
          Encryption key:off
          Power Management:off
          Link Quality=70/70  Signal level=-25 dBm  
          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
          Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:8   Missed beacon:0
</pre>

<p>Here is the view from the attacker’s perspective:</p>

<pre>KARMA: Probe Request from 00:1e:2a:18:26:60 for SSID 'badkarma'
KARMA: Probe Request from 00:1e:2a:18:26:60 for SSID 'badkarma'
KARMA: Probe Request from 00:1e:2a:18:26:60 for SSID 'badkarma'
KARMA: Probe Request from 00:1e:2a:18:26:60 for SSID 'badkarma'
KARMA: Checking SSID for start of association, pass through badkarma
KARMA: Successful association of 00:1e:2a:18:26:60
</pre>

<p>So now we’re on the network– and we know how to find it.</p>

<p><strong>Defense:</strong><br />
There are a few ways I can think of offhand to defend against this kind of attack.<br />
1. Turn off auto connect.<br />
2. Audit your devices.<br />
<del>3. Add a fake AP with bad network settings to your device. Configure your device to alert on join. </del></p>

<p>I wouldn’t recommend #3. Without other controls in place, this could open your device up to the attack we’re trying to avoid.</p>

<p>Here’s how to see what your devices are probing :</p>

<pre>atechdad@kali:~# sudo airmon-ng start wlan1
atechdad@kali:~# sudo airodump-ng mon0
</pre>

<p>You’ll see something like this. Pay attention to the second section:</p>

<pre>BSSID              STATION            PWR   Rate    Lost    Frames  Probe

 (not associated)   XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:F6  -44    0 - 1      0        1
 (not associated)   <strong>00:1E:2A:18:26:60</strong>  -59    0 - 1     86       11  <strong>badkarma
</strong></pre>

<p>You’ll notice in the second section a list of client devices. Pay attention to the Probe column</p>

<p><strong>Offense:</strong><br />
badkarma.py is a simple that works by creating a randomized AP, joining it, then deauthenticating all connected guests. It was written to run using kali linux. At minimum, it requires python, wireless-tools, the aircrack-ng suite, and mdk3 be present.</p>

<p>Sample output:</p>

<pre>atechdad@kali:~/badkarma# ./badkarma.py -i wlan1
